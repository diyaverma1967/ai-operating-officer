## about:A New World of AI Apps
A few weeks ago at #MSBuild, Kevin Scott shared Microsoft’s vision for how AI models like OpenAI’s Codex and tools like GitHub Copilot will transform how we build and interact with software. Kevin described his personal use of Codex, amazed by its ability to generate functional code from natural language in many programming languages. During Build, his team showed demos using Codex for gaming, visual design, and more, with free access to Codex and demo code for attendees.

To encourage innovation, Microsoft and OpenAI launched the Codex Innovation Challenge, inviting ideas for new Codex-powered apps. Three finalists will build prototypes and pitch them to a panel for mentorship, prizes, and a meeting with Kevin. The deadline was extended; details and demo code are available at Build AI Tools and Challenge Info.

GitHub Copilot is now generally available, helping developers write code faster. Since its technical preview, over 1.2 million have signed up, with Copilot suggesting nearly 40% of new code in languages like Python. Developers of all skill levels can try Copilot free for two months at Copilot Signup. Kevin will share more on these tools and is excited to see what people build with them.


## about: supercomputing infrsatruture

As an industry we continue to make dizzyingly rapid progress in AI, from massive supercomputing infrastructure to large AI models to the tools and applications built on top. Across it all, the first thing we think about at Microsoft is how we can deploy this AI tech safely and responsibly. This week, my colleague Brad Smith shared Microsoft’s perspective on how we best govern this technology going forward. Read more in the blog post below.
