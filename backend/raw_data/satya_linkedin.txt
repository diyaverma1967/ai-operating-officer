## Satya Nadella: AI for Good, Social Impact, and Disaster Response

Our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating fires in California.
In collaboration with Planet Labs, we leveraged our damage assessment AI models on high-resolution SkySat satellite imagery provided by Planet. This collaboration enabled us to map affected areas and generate critical insights to aid recovery efforts. These maps have been shared with organizations on the ground to assist in damage assessments and response planning.

Key Findings from Los Angeles Imagery Analysis:  
- 17,835 buildings analyzed  
- 6,251 are obscured by clouds, shadow, or smoke  
- 9,229 are likely unaffected  
- 2,355 are likely affected by the fires

The AI for Good Lab remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting affected communities during this challenging time.

## Satya Nadella: Skills and Economic Opportunity

Every general-purpose technology creates new opportunity across the economy. But it requires companies and countries to invest in new infrastructure and equip people with the right skills. And that’s what we are doing at Microsoft in this AI era, starting in the US.

As Brad Smith outlines, we want to ensure every American benefits from this AI platform shift, whether it is a scientist discovering a new drug or a high school grad launching a career in cyber security, a farmer embracing precision agriculture or a small business owner becoming more competitive.
