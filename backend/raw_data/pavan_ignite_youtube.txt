Speaker 1: Please
welcome Pavan Davaluri.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Pavan Davaluri: Thank you.
Good afternoon.
It's great to be at Ignite here
with all of you
and folks online.
Collectively, you represent
hundreds of millions
of employees across
a diverse set of business from
almost every corner
of the globe who
have chosen to win with Windows.
For that, I'm
incredibly grateful.
The energy at Ignite is real.
It comes from the opportunity to
transform productivity
in the era of AI.
Taking advantage of
that energy and that
opportunity takes real work.
Work from people in this room to
move your organizations forward,
to deliver on the
fundamentals of
security and reliability
while seizing
the opportunity to empower
your employees and to
build a real path
forward to move off
of aging technologies
like Windows 10 while
delivering measurable return on
that investment
and show progress.
These challenges and
opportunities are
both complex and motivating,
and why we're building the
next generation of Windows for
your businesses for
today and for tomorrow.
At the end of our time together,
I hope you'll see for
yourself three things.
First, that Windows is
the most reliable and
secure platform on earth.
Second, modernizing
your endpoints with
Windows 11 delivers
real business value.
And third, with AI
woven across Windows
you can unlock new levels
of productivity for
your employees.
Let's start with job number one,
keeping your organization
reliable and secure.
Windows has always
been the platform for
the world's innovation by
creating an open
operating system for
the best product makers
to do their work.
Windows has been able
to meet the needs of
over a billion customers
worldwide and,
as a result, Windows has become
a part of the global
infrastructure.
With that comes an
incredible responsibility
to remain committed
to each of you,
delivering you the
most reliable,
most secure platform on earth.
The incident that
impacted 8.5 million
devices in July was a
stark reminder that
we must remain vigilant
and continue to
innovate on a platform
that you can earn trust.
In response, we're announcing
the Windows Resiliency
Initiative to firm our commitment
to making Windows reliable and
secure for all our customers,
including mission-critical
workloads.
As a part of this initiative,
we're working together across
the industry and will improve
reliability based
on lessons from
July with new changes
in standards in the OS,
protect against malware
and script attacks with
stronger controls for
apps and drivers,
prevent phishing
attacks by enhancing
identity protection and find
a new balance to
empower employees
without the need for
local admin privileges.
Taken together, this
will ensure that
Windows remains the most
reliable platform on earth.
Please welcome David
Weston to the stage to
share more about the Windows
Resiliency Initiative.
David?
Alright,
let's do this.
David Weston: Alright.
Awesome, thank you, Pavan.
After the July incident I
talked with hundreds
of customers,
including CISOs, CIOs
and incident responders,
including many of
you here today.
They told me about the costs,
challenges and pain points you
experienced with the incident
and the associated recovery,
and you told us that
you want to keep
your existing security
capabilities while at
the same time making it easier
to prevent and
recover from issues.
Your feedback provides
essential learning
we're applying to
ensure incidents like
this never happen again.
You told us we need to
act on three big things.
One, making Windows
easier to recover.
Two, strengthening
the resilience of
critical security tools
and drivers and three,
improving the
overall security of
the platform so it's more
effective and self-defending,
reducing the overall complexity.
We heard you and we are acting.
I'm here today to
tell you what we're
doing to address all
of this feedback,
so let's get started
with the first pillar of
the Windows Resiliency
Initiative,
improving Windows reliability.
We are working on new Windows
capabilities to enable
security product
developers to build
their products outside
of kernel mode.
We call this our Windows
Resilient Security Platform.
This is a flexible security API
set and data collection
points that can be used to
build endpoint security
products like detection and
response or antivirus
outside of the kernel.
This means security
products like antivirus or
EDR solutions can run in user
mode just like an app does.
We're assuring this
platform will enable
security solution providers
to have the access they need
to detect and respond to threats
without introducing
complexity into the kernel.
This change will help end
user protection and
antivirus products provide
a high level of security
and easier recovery and,
most importantly, there'll
be less impact to
Windows in the even of
a crash or a mistake.
We plan to have a private
preview to share with
our security product
ecosystem in July of 2025.
Next, we heard you on the need
to recover Windows
quickly during
an incident and we built
something to do this
at planetary scale.
Coming to the Windows
Insider Program in Q1 of
2025 and then the broader
Windows release after that,
we are building a new solution
for Quick Machine Recovery.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Quick Machine Recovery can
execute targeted fixes from
Windows update on machines,
even when Windows
is unable to boot.
With this new solution,
we can use the trusted
Windows pipeline to
quickly deploy fixes
that address files,
drivers or any other operation
needed to recover a
non-bootable machine.
In addition to recovery
capabilities built in to Windows,
we want to make sure the
security products you have
today are more reliable
and more resilient,
so we included
the entire Windows ecosystem
in this initiative.
To accomplish this,
we brought together
our industry-leading
security partners along with
the US Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency
for a Windows endpoint
security ecosystem summit.
The goal was to define new
ways to increase resilience
across the ecosystem and
ensure Windows remains
an open platform,
enabling user choice
and innovation while
also maintaining the highest
standards for security.
Microsoft Virus
Initiative partners from
around the globe, including
Microsoft Defender,
are committing to
taking specific steps
to enhance both security
and resiliency.
One of the most
important steps is
adopting safe
deployment practices,
which means that all
security products updates
must be gradual,
they must leverage
deployment rings
and must employ monitoring to
ensure any negative impact from
an update is kept to
an absolute minimum.
Partners must also conduct
additional security and
compatibility testing for
components like a
security kernel driver to
ensure issues are detected
before any incident can occur.
Microsoft and our MVI
partners are also working
together to develop strengthened
incident response processes
for streamlined coordination
to move quickly and
decisively together to keep
everyone up and running.
As I mentioned earlier,
CISA is an important participant
in determining a new set
of security and resiliency
standards for Windows endpoints.
They are providing
a framework for
the whole IT industry to
ensure that all partners,
customers and organizations are
able to stay ahead of
evolving security threats.
CISA recently released
guidelines for how
the IT ecosystem in the
United States must use
safe deployment practices
to avoid widespread issues
that impacted so
many organizations
and customers in July.
Now, let's here
directly from CISA.
Bob Lord: Hey, everybody.
Thanks so much for having us.
My name is Bob Lord and I'm
a Senior Technical
Advisor at CISA.
Jack Cable: My name
is Jack Cable and I'm
a Senior Technical
Advisor at CISA,
the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency.
CISA leads the nation's efforts
to manage and reduce risks
to our critical infrastructure
and federal civilian
government systems.
Bob Lord: We were pleased
to participate in
the Microsoft Windows endpoint
security summit and look forward
to ongoing collaboration for
ways that we can all
work together to make
sure that we are building
software that is
safe, secure and resilient.
To that end, CISA has published
a white paper on safe
software deployments,
and in it we talk about
some of the major elements
of producing software that is
not just secure by design,
not just secure by default but
is secure through the
delivery to the customers,
whether that's software
that you deliver
directly or through
online services.
Jack Cable: This
paper aims to fill
existing gaps in the
literature by providing
a foundation for six common
steps of software deployment.
It's our hope that through
this guidance software
manufacturers
can understand how to deliver
updates to their customers in
a manner that is secure and
reliable such as through
internal testing and
canary releases.
Bob Lord: Thank you
for your attention.
We really want to have
a larger conversation
about what it takes for
the industry to deliver
software that is safe and
secure and resilient.
Thank you.
David Weston: In
addition to the work we
are doing with CISA as
part of Microsoft's
Secure Future Initiative,
we are heavily investing in
safe languages to enhance
the safety of our code.
This commitment also aligns with
CISA's secure by design pledge.
We're applying this
new approach to
our security platform
and other key areas
like Microsoft
Surface's firmware
and the Pluton security
processor firmware.
Part of becoming
resilient is also
increasing the
prevention of attacks,
so more security
has been built into
the operating system and
not bolted on later.
This reduces complexity
and ensures you
deploy less software that
could become the
next failure point.
This is why we are targeting
the most critical
elements of Windows 11.
We analyzed the trillions
of security events we
get every day from over
a billion endpoints
and combined that with the
information we get through
AI and the Microsoft Threat
Intelligence Center.
Based on this, the largest
source of attacks are clear.
Unverified application,
credential-based attacks
and admin privileges.
Let me tell you how
we're addressing
this to keep you safer.
First, we are asserting
stronger controls for
what app and drivers
are allowed to run
in the Windows OS.
This is important as
unverified apps and drivers
lead to malware and
script-based attacks,
and most malware and
ransomware apps are unsigned,
which means they
can be authored and
distributed without
being provably safe.
Smart App Control and
App Control for Business
policies provide peace of
mind that only verified apps
can run on your device.
This has always been
possible with products like
App Control or AppLocker,
but they could be really
complicated to manage,
but with the power of AI
we've made it much
simpler to deploy.
IT admins can simply select
the Microsoft Cloud Policy
in the App Control wizard,
which enables millions of
known safe apps to run
regardless of where
they are deployed from,
and line of business apps
unknown to Microsoft
can be easily
added through policy changes
or via Intune managed
app deployment.
Robust app control ensures
that only verified apps can run,
and this eliminates attacks like
malicious attachments or
social-engineered malware.
Now let's talk about how we're
stopping identity attacks.
We all know phishing
is a huge problem.
Microsoft Entra data shows that
more than 600 million identity
attacks occur per day,
and over 99% of those
are password-based.
In response, we've
hardened Windows Hello,
which is our Windows
built-in MFA solution.
We're using the new
hardware included in
Copilot+ and secured-core PCs
to isolate and protect
the biometrics involved as
well as to protect credentials,
and Windows Hello has been
extended to support passkeys,
which means much
of the web can be
protected with MFA seamlessly.
Now, you no longer need
to choose between a
simple sign-in and a safe one.
Windows Hello is also being
used to protect things like
Windows Recall and
personal data encryption.
Finally, the new feature I am
most excited about creates
a new balance to
empower employees
without the need for
local admin privileges.
Over-privileged users
and applications are
a long-standing challenge and
they create significant risk.
In fact, compromise of
high-privilege users and
apps make up the bulk of attack
vectors used in breaches.
Our Microsoft Digital Defense
Report calls that out.
93% of our ransomware
incident response engagements
revealed insufficient
controls on
privileges as well
as lateral movement,
so we're introducing
administrator protection.
With admin protection
employees have
standard user permissions by
default so they can still
make Windows systems changes,
including app installation,
but only when
necessary and only after
authorizing the change
using Windows Hello.
Admin protection will be
incredibly disruptive to
attackers as they no longer
have elevated
privileges by default,
and it will help
ensure that employees,
not malware, remain in
control of Windows.
I am incredibly
excited for you to try
these new features and
share your feedback.
Rest assured, Windows
remains committed
to staying an open
platform for innovation,
providing flexibility
and customer choice
without locking down
the operating system
or determining a single way of
working while enhancing security
and reliability for all.
That's what the Windows
Resiliency Initiative
is all about.
Moving to Windows 11 is
a key part of achieving
an optimal security
posture because
the latest OS is
always the safest OS.
Windows 11 is the most
secure operating system
we have ever built
because we applied a secure by
design strategy from the
very first line of code.
Now, let's talk about what
sets Windows 11 apart.
First, we have established a
hardware security baseline.
This ensures every Win11 PC has
consistent hardware security
forming a secure foundation,
and this foundation gives
you confidence in
the security of
the operating system and
all other experiences
built on top of it.
Windows 11 is more
secure by default.
We are adding new security
capabilities with
each release to stay ahead
of emerging threats.
These changes include enabling
credential protection
by default,
removing legacy attack surfaces
and moving old code
out of the kernel.
We have confidence that
our Windows security strategy is
raising the bar for
your protection.
After transitioning from
Windows 10 to Windows 11,
research shows a 62% drop
in security incidents,
three time reported reduction in
firmware attacks and 80% of
customers are telling us
that new Windows 11 PCs provide
better security and
data protection
than their older devices.
As I said earlier,
the latest version
of Windows is always
the most secure
version of Windows
and it's only getting better.
For example, we just added
personal data encryption
to Windows Enterprise.
This is a second method
of encryption on top of
BitLocker to protect your
most sensitive files.
These files can only be
decrypted by a user
via Windows Hello.
We've also added things like
additional kernel
protection with hardware,
more safe language usage
across the operating
system and we've
even introduced a new,
hardened printer stack.
Our security teams
are working hard for
you so you don't need to spend
your time enabling security
on new or upgraded PCs,
and we will continue
to innovate based on
your feedback across
client and cloud.
The most important action
you can take today to secure
your organization is to move to
Windows 11 on a new,
secured-core PC,
or with Windows 365 cloud PCs,
because Windows
11 is designed to
meet both today and
tomorrow's threats,
not those of 10 years ago.
Security is a team sport,
so everyone needs to adopt
the security and
reliability practices
outlined in the Windows
Resiliency Initiative.
Please keep your
feedback coming.
We are listening
and we are acting
so you can count on Windows
for everything you do.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Mark Lambourne: We play
a critical role in
supporting and enabling
global economies.
The London Stock
Exchange Group is one of
the world's leading financial
market infrastructure providers.
Sandra Lee: Windows
365 and the Windows
11 provided us with
the capability,
the operational resilience,
the security that we
needed to be able to
provide a secure
platform on which
to build our products
and services off.
Mark Lambourne: By
having one platform,
engineering effort for us has
shrunk down to about half.
Under our previous
set of capabilities,
developers had to log on to
multiple different desktops.
Paul Gravestock: We feel the
future is very exciting with
the capabilities that
these tools give
us to be able to rapidly
deploy and deliver
products to our clients.
Sandra Lee: Using the
Windows 365 platform,
our developers are
able to access
GitHub Copilot to be able to
leverage from the AI capability
to more efficiently
develop their code.
Mark Lambourne: On
new platform Windows
11 devices and Windows
365 gives us that strong
foundation, well-designed,
well-architected to
bring new innovation
with much lower friction,
much lower time to
market and get business value
delivered more quickly.
Sandra Lee: We've
seen an increase in
customer satisfaction but
also, more importantly,
from an operational perspective,
the reduced time and
effort to maintain and
sustain a standard secure
operating platform.
Mark Lambourne: We're
really excited to
see the value that it brings.
We think it might be quite
profound for our organization.
[ MUSIC ]
Pavan Davaluri: That was
awesome. Windows represents
an opportunity to
modernize your endpoints,
both for your PC fleet
and your cloud clients.
Just like the London
Stock Exchange,
you too can create a
strong foundation to
deliver innovation and
business value faster.
Today we'll talk about the
benefits of Windows 11 and how
we're enabling the move from
Windows 10 for your PCs,
VDI and DaaS solutions.
Customers are
choosing to modernize
their fleet for
three key reasons.
First, better security
and resiliency.
Second, streamlined
management and compatibility,
and third, increased
employee productivity.
Together, these
benefits will deliver
meaningful return on
investment for your business.
Let's start with your PC fleet.
With Windows 10 end of
support coming October 2025,
now is the time to move to
Windows 11 with confidence.
We understand change isn't easy,
and we're working hard
to make the move to
Windows 11 more compelling
and easier than ever.
As you just heard from David,
Windows 11 is more secure
by default and by design.
It's the single most
important reason customers
are moving to Windows 11 today.
Customers like Carlsberg
are taking advantage of
Windows 11 security baseline to
protect their entire
global workforce.
They have peace of mind knowing
their endpoints
are hardened with
the latest security
features designed to
protect against modern
and evolving threats.
We've simplified
managing the move to
Windows 11 to minimize
disruption to your workforce.
Windows 11 can be managed
with the same tools and
processes you use with
Windows 10 today,
and Windows 11 is compatible
with all of your apps,
backed by our App
Assure promise.
Once you've transitioned,
it's easy to stay up to date.
Regular Windows 11 updates
are 40% smaller in size.
That's why iconic companies like
Levi's are leaning into the
future and making the move.
After piloting Windows 11,
Levi's realized the benefits of
a streamlined and productive
employee experience.
They quickly deployed Windows 11
to their global workforce,
utilizing Autopilot to ship
new devices directly from
the factory to employees,
who securely set up
their new PCs with
Intune and Entra ID.
Windows 11 is faster and more
productive for employees.
You can choose the
right modern hardware
for your organization from
Surface and from
our incredible Windows
ecosystem partners.
Newer Windows 11 devices
deliver vastly
improved performance,
even from just a few years ago.
When you compare these
older Win10 devices that
don't meet the Windows 11
hardware specifications,
the difference is clear.
Employees get over double
the battery life and
more than three times
the faster performance.
Upgrading from an
older Windows 10 PC to
a new Windows 11 PC will
significantly boost
productivity of your employees,
and this year we've raised
the bar on what you can
achieve with new
PCs built for AI.
In May, together with our
silicon and OEM partners,
we announced a new category
of devices, Copilot+ PCs.
They're built for productivity
and they're the fastest,
most intelligent and
secure PCs available.
Top Copilot+ PCs are
up to 58% faster than
a MacBook Air M3,
and all the benefits
of security,
manageability and increased
productivity come
together this week with two
announcements we're sharing.
I'm excited to announce
Windows Backup for Entra ID,
available in public
preview this spring.
You've told us
that personalizing
a new PC is time-consuming
for employees.
With Windows Backup, you can
easily transition
new PC settings and
preferences and set up
a new PC or perform a
traditional reinstall.
Preferences like desktop
background and icon size appear
on the new PC in
the same way that they
did on the old device.
This reduces the time spent on
set-up so employees can
be productive faster,
while significantly reducing IT
overhead and help desk calls.
I'm also thrilled to
announce Windows Hotpatch,
coming to Windows
11 Enterprise and
Windows 365 this spring.
[ APPLAUSE ]
It's one of my favorites.
Pavan Davaluri: Using
Windows Hotpatch through
your autopatch
settings in Intune,
you can now seamlessly deliver
Patch Tuesday security updates
directly to your
employees on day one.
With Windows Hotpatch, 65% of
Patch Tuesday
security updates are
directly delivered without
requiring a restart.
Reducing restarts and
interruptions means
security updates get
deployed 60% faster.
Over a million businesses have
already made the
move to Windows 11.
These companies are seeing
faster workflows and
increased productivity
and cost savings from
fewer help desk tickets and
reduced security instance.
In fact, according to
Forrester research,
moving to Windows 11 delivers
an amazing 250% return on
investment over three years.
Modernizing isn't just
about cost savings.
It's about our collective
responsibility and
impact on the global economy
and the environment.
Like you, Microsoft
has committed
to advancing sustainability and
adopting Windows 11 helps in
achieving your company's
sustainability goals.
Windows 11 reduces energy use as
the world's first
carbon-aware OS
and offers Energy Saver,
increasing energy
efficiency by up to 22%.
More devices are
manufactured using
recycled materials and
more renewable energy.
For example, Surface
enclosures use
100% recycled aluminum alloy and
100% recycled rare
earth materials.
Programs are available
to reduce e-waste with
the recycling and
refurbishment opportunities
available across our
ecosystem partners.
There's also the
option to extend
the life of older hardware with
Windows 365 without sacrificing
security protection
or experience.
Together, we can
make a difference in
sustainability as we move
to the next generation
of Windows.
For those of you
who've already moved
your PC fleet to
Windows 11, thank you.
For those of you that
are working towards
the October 2025 deadline,
we look forward to
partnering with you.
We want all of you to experience
the benefits of better security,
improved management and
increased productivity
that Windows 11 delivers,
and all these benefits
extend to the cloud.
Three years ago, we launched
Windows 365 in response to
customer demand for a simple,
secure SaaS solution for
Windows to empower people to
work flexibly from anywhere,
and we named this
new category of
end user computing Cloud PC.
It fundamentally re-imagines VDI
and DaaS by lowering cost,
delivering the
best-in-class employee
experience and helping
IT be more efficient.
Windows 365 securely streams
your full personal desktop
with all your apps,
content and settings
directly from
the Microsoft Cloud
to any device.
It's simple to deploy
with just a few clicks in
Intune and scalable
to thousands of PCs.
Windows 365 gives you
the flexibility to have
a tailor-made Windows
experience for
every employee in
every organization.
To tell you more, please
welcome Aidan Marcuss
to the stage.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Pavan Davaluri: Alright,
Aidan. Let's do this.
Aidan Marcuss: Alright.
Thank you, Pavan.
It's great to be here
today with all of you.
Customers choose Windows 365
because they can
deploy in hours,
not months, connect in seconds,
not minutes, all while
reducing their IT
infrastructure and
management complexity.
Customers like Johnson
&amp; Johnson deployed
Windows 365 to modernize
the way they manage
their desktops,
to improve the user experience,
lower cost and complexity and
simplify their
operational environment.
Wells Fargo is moving
off of legacy on-prem
VDI to Windows 365
as part of a wholesale
modernization strategy.
Based on user personas,
they're bringing
multiple workloads to
the cloud for better security,
better efficiency and lower TCO.
Your energy, engagement
and feedback
powers our team to keep
innovating. Thank you.
You can hear directly from
Johnson &amp; Johnson and
Wells Fargo tomorrow in one
of our breakout sessions.
They are among thousands of
customers who are adopting
Windows 365 to serve
a wide variety of scenarios
within their organizations,
and with the ability to pick
exactly what you need
with options from
basic productivity to
developer machines to
powerful GPU machines capable
of handling the
most sophisticated,
high-capacity computing
tasks, it's not
just the best way to
modernize your on-prem VDI.
It gives you way
more flexibility
to do more with Windows 11.
Windows 365 now is going
where you said you needed it,
on any endpoint for everyone
in your organization.
It's great on Windows 11 PCs,
including new Copilot+ PCs
with unique features like
boot directly to
your Cloud PC and
switch to your side-by-side
cloud desktop.
In fact, Windows PCs are
the number one endpoint
for Windows 365,
but with broader
Windows app support,
new solutions like
Frontline Shared,
new cloud-first endpoints
and even mixed reality,
Windows 365 is built for you
and how you need to use it.
Let's go deeper into
the new solutions we
announced this week,
starting with the Windows App.
Launched earlier this year,
it makes Windows 365 available
for every employee however
they want to work.
The Windows App
allows you to access
Microsoft's virtualization
services on an iPad,
a Mac or a Windows PC
with a single click.
It's simple to use,
consistent across endpoints and
delivers a complete
Windows solution.
Hundreds of thousands
of you have
embraced it and are
starting to use it.
Now we're expanding
the Windows app
to even more endpoints,
bringing that Windows app
to the Android platform.
It's in preview today and
available in the
Google Play Store.
I can't wait for all
of you to try it.
Based on your feedback,
we're going to
enhance the way you
can manage the Windows App.
Windows 365 is a
popular choice for
temporary and mobile workers
as well as bring-your-own-device
scenarios,
and we want to make it even
easier and more secure for you.
We're excited to announce
mobile application management
support in the Windows App.
Mobile application
management enables
lightweight but still highly
secure management to support
employees and
contractors who need to
access data in applications
on their personal devices.
Only Windows 365 can enable
secure, managed
access everywhere.
This week, we also announced
a new solution for
Frontline workers.
Windows 365 Frontline Shared
delivers the same secure,
high-fidelity Windows
365 experience but takes
a single Cloud PC and
lets it be shared
across many Frontline
workers during the day.
This is something you asked for
on behalf of your employees who
need to use Windows 365
occasionally to do their job.
With Frontline Shared,
every person gets the same,
consistent apps and set-up
every time they log in.
Our team prioritized
getting this
out because you told
us you want to extend
Windows 365 to more employees
so they can do their
best work on Windows.
Here at Ignite,
we also announced
our first dedicated device for
Windows in the cloud,
Windows 365 Link.
This new hardware expands
the Cloud PC category
by connecting
you directly to your
productivity in the cloud.
You asked for a simple,
secure endpoint with no data
or information left
onto the device,
and Windows 365 Link
delivers just that.
It's admin-less, it's
password-less and
configured with strong
security defaults
that cannot be disabled.
It's the perfect device
for employee working
at a hotdesk,
a call center or another
shared or specialized space.
It sets up in
literally minutes with
two 4K monitors as
well as all kinds of
common peripherals.
It's got a full complement
of ports and Bluetooth.
You can pick the
identity access choice
that's right for you,
including biometric keys and
multi-factor authentication
using Entra ID.
Windows 365 Link helps you lower
your total cost of
ownership without
sacrificing employee
experience or
requiring new tools or
learning new processes.
Let's take a look at
just how easy it is to
get started with the
Windows 365 Link.
I want you to watch this clock,
which is in the corner,
as we get set up.
The device has arrived and Alex,
our IT admin, is ready to
begin setting up a shared
hotdesk in the office.
He gets it connected to all
the peripherals needed.
He plugs in two monitors,
the USB dongle to connect
the wireless mouse and keyboard,
the Ethernet cable
and the camera.
All set up, he powers
the device on.
Now the simple set-up
process begins.
The Link is Wi-Fi,
but because Alex plugged in
an Ethernet cable that
step is just skipped.
All he has to do is sign
in with his Entra ID,
which will connect the device
to the corporate tenant.
Alex enters his
work email address
and authenticates using a
security key with a PIN.
The device is now
automatically joining
the company's Entra tenant
and enrolling in Intune,
enabling the device to be
cloud-only and fully managed.
Entra's strong
authentication methods,
conditional access
policies and single
sign-on eliminate the need
for a password on this endpoint,
and security features
like Secure Boot,
BitLocker and Hypervisor-protected
code integrity
are enabled by default
and cannot be disabled.
There's no local data,
no local apps, so corporate
data is never on the device.
With no local admin user
and strict application
control policies,
no local software
can be installed.
The set-up process
is now complete,
seamlessly connecting Alex to
his personal Cloud PC
right where he left off,
all done in under three minutes.
This device is now ready for
any Windows 365 user
in that tenant.
Now Jaylene, an employee,
sits down at the desk
to begin her day.
She plugs in her FIDO2
security key to the device,
touches the biometric reader to
authenticate and connects
to her personal Cloud PC.
The presentation
she's been working
on is opened up right
where she left it.
She makes progress, she does
some work and then signs
out of the device.
With the desk open, employees
come and go throughout the day,
each quickly getting
their Cloud PC.
Less than three minutes
from box to productive
with the Link.
The simple, secure, purpose-built
device for Windows 365.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Now this is the first dedicated
device for Windows 365,
but we're not stopping here.
Cloud PCs are designed
to complement
your Windows 11 end
user computing estate.
To do that, we'll enable more
endpoints and form factors,
scaling with our OEM
ecosystem partners to
unlock more value and
more options for you.
Now, let's talk about
how great Windows 365
is on a Windows 11 PC.
Here, Serena, a designer,
is using her Copilot+
PC to log in
to her GPU-powered Cloud PC,
access a super-powerful
CAD application with
Creo and then join
a Teams call and share that
design with a colleague.
What she's doing
in that scenario,
she's actually
mixing the power of
her Copilot+ PC where she gets
all the Teams
effects, the framing,
the audio quality, with this
powerful GPU in the cloud,
seamlessly blending those to get
done the work that she needed
to get done and share it.
Windows 365 extends the Windows
experience everywhere you
work with the performance and
security you can count on.
It's really easy to get started
with Windows in the cloud today.
We have some breakout
sessions tomorrow,
please join us for those
where we'll go into
depth into all of these things.
Now I'll hand it back
to Pavan. Thank you.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Pavan Davaluri: That
is amazing, Aidan.
Thank you, thank you.
The work you're doing to secure
and modernize with Windows 11
today will be the foundation
of employee
empowerment tomorrow.
Windows has from its
very inception been
about enabling each of
us to do our best work,
and that truth remains
at the heart of
why many of you choose Windows,
so we will continue working
to empower your employees,
making Windows the most
productive platform on Earth.
Today, most employees
and enterprise have
both Windows and Microsoft 365,
and we can improve
their daily experience
by innovating on how
Microsoft 365 and
Windows work together.
Simple changes make
a big difference,
like making it easier to
find your M365 apps and
content directly from
File Explorer with access
to modern file types like
LUP and the ability to
connect directly
with collaborators
using the people card,
M365 companions and such.
We will also introduce a
new set of experiences
that puts your
Microsoft 365 people,
files and calendar
right on your taskbar.
This makes it easier
to find people in
your org and collaborate
with those you work
with the most,
giving you instant access
and ability to share
the most important content and
helping you manage your time.
All this just a click away
on your Windows desktop.
These are meaningful steps
forward for your
employee's productivity,
and AI gives us
an opportunity to
make a giant leap forward.
This is why we're
building Windows to be
the destination for AI.
Copilot+ PCs set
a new bar for how
a PC can enable productivity.
They're the most secure,
most intelligent PCs we've ever
built and they deliver new
standards in performance,
reliability and quality,
but most importantly,
they are the first PCs
built for integrated,
concurrent, pervasive
AI workloads.
With co-engineered silicon
from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm,
they deliver the world's
most advanced AI
inferencing capabilities
directly on a laptop.
Copilot+ PCs combined with
Windows and the Windows
Copilot Runtime
are built from the
ground up to extend
Microsoft's Copilot
stack to the client.
They will enable innovations,
enable the world, quite frankly,
to bring their best
innovations to
Windows, from Anthropic, Meta,
OpenAI, Hugging Face to ISVs
like Adobe, LiquidText,
Microsoft 365 and countless
more who are already taking
advantage of the platform,
all with the simple
objective of not
just solving
challenges of today,
but helping you leap forward
and harness AI for tomorrow.
I'd like to introduce
Navjot Virk to
tell you more, but
before I do that,
let's take a look at how
Copilot+ PCs and Windows
will empower your employees.
[ MUSIC ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
Navjot Virk: Thank you,
Pavan, and I hope all of you
are as energized by
this video as I am.
There's a lot to cover,
so let's dive in.
Empowering employee
productivity is
at the heart of
everything we build.
By leveraging the world's
most powerful AI,
we're creating new experiences
for your employees,
helping them be more productive,
collaborative and
satisfied at work.
This is designing
for business AI.
Our innovation is centered on
three important aspects
of employee productivity.
First, helping you find the
information you need fast.
Second, simplifying
your workflows
by making it easier
to get things done.
Third, enabling you
to more effectively
collaborate so you can be
seen, heard and understood.
As a result, we have created
an experience with
less friction,
richer context and greater
capabilities for everyone.
We've heard from you and
your employees loud
and clear that one of
the most frustrating
problems you face
every day is finding what
you're looking for on your PC.
Hold on, my mic is
trying to misbehave.
Okay. Today, there are
billions of searches
on Windows and way too
many of them don't
come back with
the results you're looking
for, wasting valuable time.
With Copilot+ PCs and
their powerful NPUs,
we are making finding
what you're looking
for a whole lot
easier and smarter.
We are making Windows Search
intelligent by unlocking
natural language search.
Just describe what
you're trying to find,
whether it's text or images,
and Windows will search
based on your intent,
even if it doesn't match
the exact file name.
Search for last
month's sales report,
an important contract
or strategy document
by simply describing
what you remember.
Next year, we will bring
Federated Intelligent
Windows Search
for Microsoft 365 customers,
so you can easily find
not only your local files but
also your OneDrive
for Business files.
We'll be bringing Intelligent
Windows Search to
settings and expanding to
the Windows search
box next year too.
With Recall, we introduced
an entirely new way
to securely search for things
you've seen on your PC.
We appreciate all
your early feedback
and want to recognize
the contribution of researchers
and the security community
in shaping Recall.
For managed devices, in
managed organizations,
Recall comes with granular
management controls
and is off by default.
We've also added meaningful
security enhancements,
including additional layers of
data protection and
Windows Hello protection.
As a result, this experience is
one of the most secure
designs we have ever built,
raising the bar for
personal data protection,
so you can have peace
of mind when you
decide to enable this
feature for your employees.
Of course, we're not done.
We'll continue to
work with all of
you on building manageability,
trust and value for
new AI experiences like
Recall on Windows.
With tools like Federated
Intelligent Windows
Search and Recall,
we're helping your employees
easily find what they're looking
for in a way only Microsoft can.
Your employees also tell us it's
easy to get distracted
and pulled away from
what's important when
you're switching
between tasks and navigating
between applications.
That's why we're
bringing AI when
and where you need it to
simplify your workflows.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is
your AI companion for work.
Copilot is already becoming
a daily habit for people
around the world.
Nearly 70% of Fortune
500 companies are
using it for tasks
like summarized text,
drafting responses and catching
up on what they
might have missed.
We are accelerating our
ambition to give every employee
a Copilot and to transform
every business process with
agents build in Copilot Studio.
With the Copilot Key
on Copilot+ PCs,
all that incredible innovation
is just a click away,
making it faster to access
Copilot whenever you need it.
Now, by leveraging the power of
MPU to run AI models locally,
Copilot+ PCs help you
get even more value
from your Microsoft
365 Copilot license.
We're announcing local
rewrite and summarize in
Outlook and local
rewrite in Word so you
can get real-time and
private AI inline.
This experience is Cyber
Executive Order-compliant,
unlocking AI in even the
most regulated industries.
Now, let's talk about one
of my favorite
features, Click to Do.
With Click to Do,
we are introducing
an all-new powerful
productivity paradigm that
puts AI right at your
fingertips to assist
with common tasks across
all your applications.
Click to Do connects you to
AI actions based on the context
of what's on your screen,
making it faster and
easier to get things done.
Just press the Windows
Key and left click,
or invoke from one of
our most-loved apps,
snipping tool, and let
AI analyze your screen.
It automatically shows you
the most relevant set of
AI actions based on
what you've selected.
You can get access to
AI writing tools like
rewrite and summarize
directly in line,
or get recommendations for
other helpful visual tools to
quickly complete your task.
Click to Do works with
all of your line of
business applications.
For example, you
can do things like
summarize a
knowledge-based article
you're reading in ServiceNow.
Content on your screen is never
saved so your information
stays secure and private.
Click to Do saves you time
and keeps you focused.
Windows wants to help
everyone do their best work.
Narrator is a
screenwriting application
built in to Windows,
designed to help people with
no or low vision
understand and navigate
what's on the screen.
Now that experience
is even better.
With the power of NPU,
AI generates a
richer description
of visual content like graphs,
charts and images so
your employees will get
more equitable access to
information with
richer descriptions.
Whether it's Copilot
at your fingertips
or Click to Do with AI actions
when and where you need them,
Copilot+ PCs empower
every employee
to simplify their workflow.
Finally, we have built
Copilot+ PCs to be
the best PCs for
employee collaboration so
everyone can be better seen,
heard and understood
in meetings.
We are introducing super
resolution in Teams.
Leveraging the power of the NPU,
Teams automatically enhances
incoming video quality
when collaborators have
bandwidth constraints
or a poor network connection.
Coupled with battery life and
performance enhancements,
Copilot+ PCs are the
best endpoint for Teams.
Live captions with
live translations
turn any audio into a single,
consistent English-captioned
experience in
real time on your screen.
With translation support for
over 40 languages into English,
we're making it easier to
collaborate with fewer
language barriers.
Windows Studio Effects provide
helpful visual and audio filters
so you can look and
sound your best,
whether you're on Teams, Zoom,
WhatsApp or any other
video conferencing app.
These experiences matter.
With simpler workflows,
ability to find information
faster and tools to be
better collaborators,
your employees will feel more
empowered and productive
when working on Windows.
We invite you to come and see us
on the show floor where
you can learn even more.
The NPU-powered experiences
I've shown you,
including the ones in your
Microsoft 365 applications,
are powered by Windows
Copilot Runtime.
It includes the Windows
Copilot Runtime APIs,
powered by over 40
on-device AI models
and AI frameworks to bring
your own AI models to Windows,
offering a secure,
efficient and reliable
platform for developers to
create innovative experiences.
Today, we're announcing
new imaging AI APIs
in Windows Copilot Runtime,
like those used by
Click to Do and
our Microsoft 365 experiences,
so your developers
can use them to
enhance your commercial or
line of business applications.
For example, LiquidText,
a note-taking app
that offers a fast,
natural way to review,
gather and organize information
across all your documents.
Now, on Copilot+ PC,
we're launching an experience
called auto-citation.
This lets you easily
add citations to
your notes and is powered
by natural language search.
This is a great example
of an ISV bringing
their own AI models
and scaling across
Windows using our AI
frameworks to create
new value with an experience
that is reliable,
fast, secure and private.
Whether you're one of
the world's largest ISVs
like our very own M365,
or a small company
just getting started,
join the hundreds
of apps already
developing with Windows
Copilot Runtime.
Learn more about how
you can get started at
the Windows Copilot
Runtime breakout session
tomorrow morning at 9:45.
This is just the start.
The future of business
AI on Windows is here,
and we cannot wait to see what
you do with the power and
possibilities of
Copilot+ PCs. Thank you.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Dave Dame: What I want
to do near this end of
my career is to make sure
there are going to be
many others after
me and along me
that get to get the
life that I've had.
I'm Dave Dame,
Senior Director of Product
Accessibility at Microsoft.
At Microsoft, we want to empower
everyone on the planet
to achieve more.
Voice access, wake up.
It would usually take me
14 minutes to do an email.
Draft an email about the
annual fundraising campaign.
Now with Windows
and M365 Copilot,
I can generate it in minutes.
New paragraph, thanks,
comma. New line, Dave.
It makes it possible for
people with disabilities,
but it gives everyone else
options and freedoms
because we're using
the natural things
we do as humans to
be more productive and
be more efficient,
which then results into
getting the most out
of the collective.
You're getting that time,
that precious time, to think,
to create, to design,
to be able to reinvent something
new instead of just
iterating on what has been.
When you design for
accessibility, it is innovation.
Design for one and
extend to many.
[ APPLAUSE ]
Pavan Davaluri: Just think
about the diversity of
lives and businesses
Windows touches.
With this kind of impact comes
incredible opportunity
and responsibility.
We believe that AI
has the power to make
technology more accessible
and more inclusive,
so we're designing Windows
to be accessible for all.
Let's bring this together.
You told us security
is your top priority,
so we shared how
we're working to make
Windows the most secure and most
reliable platform
for the future and
now with the Windows
Resiliency Initiative.
You asked us for help to
modernize your endpoints,
so we're working hard to
make it easier than
ever to move to
Windows 11 for your fleet
across cloud and client.
Finally, you asked how you can
bring AI capabilities
for your employees,
so with the power of
Microsoft 365 Copilot,
Windows and Copilot+ PCs,
we showed you the
journey we're on.
This is just the start
of a new AI era at work.
There is so much more to come.
We invite you to hear more
from our breakout sessions.
Thank you all for being here.
You inspire us, you
push us to innovate
and to deliver for both
today's and tomorrow's
business needs.
I'm grateful to be on this
journey with you. Thank you.
